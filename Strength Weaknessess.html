    <h2>"GIVE ME LOVE THAT WILL BOOST MY STRENGTHS"</h2>
    <br>

   <p><b>When I was a child I am not really into gadgets because I prefer playing street games with my childhood friends.My weaknesses is that I don't know how to use computer/ laptop properly because I don't really use them before.
    <br>Because of this, right now I was left behind by my classmates in knowledge about using these things because they're using it since then. However, I have a strengths that I will use  to provide the knowledge gap.
    <br>My Strengths is that I always willing to learn that's why I always value the knowledge I learn from everything and use it in my life.
       I also considered my habit the thirst to grow as one of my strengths because it helps me to build the person who I really want to be. My last strength is I'm a fast leaner, I always understand the lessons in a short period of time.
    <br> But this has a downside because even though I'm a fast learner I have short term memory,that's why I should study the lessons again and again. </b>
