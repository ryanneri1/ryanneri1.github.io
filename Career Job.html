    <br>
 
    <p><b>After four years in college studying Information Technology I see my self as a I.T Lecturer. I know in my state right now I have so many things to learn before achieving this because the foundation of my knowledge about things like these is so small.That's why in this four years of my college life I will make sure that I will gain knowledge that will help me.<br>
      I want to be an I.T Lecturer because I want to  teach those students that doesn't have knowledge about Information Technology. I want to teach them that like me a someone who doesn't have knowledge about computer can be so good at using this because of studying. I also want to teach some basic learnings and trainings to everyone so that they can avoid scams and other bad things that's happening on online world.</b>
